## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
- You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

### General
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or software of your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
  - As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
  - Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
  - For the following tasks, insert the link from your screenshot into the answer file
  - After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
  - You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff, or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
- Focus on what you are being asked:
  - Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
  - Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
  - Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
  - In this project, again, avoid going into details if not asked
